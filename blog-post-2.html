        <h3 style="color: white;">Water - The Other Truth</h3>
        <p style="color: white;">Date: January 23, 2024</p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            This is very essential in today's world. These are dark times where every human has succumbed to his desire for 
            water. One can speak of this any number of times and still wouldn't be enough. Doctors speak about the importance 
            of water all the time. Everybody speaks of the importance of water. Do we really need it? What is the truth about 
            water? Let's find out.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white;">
            I have been involved in an experiment for all my 18 years of existance, where I try to survive on as little water 
            possible. I have been successful in this experiment and I have been able to survive on as little as 1 litre of water 
            a week. So the question is why is the world so obsessed with water? Perhaps all the big brand water companies are 
            trying to milk the common man for every last penny. Or perhaps it's the government's ploy to keep us under control. 
            Considering that mankind as a whole has succumbed to the weakness of water a long long time ago, we will never know 
            the truth.
